    <!-- first paragraph (step 3 answered here) -->
    <p>Hi! I'm Namrata Rajaraman, and I attend NC State University.
    <!-- bold, italic and underlined are the tags in this paragraph (css step 1 answered here) -->
    I'm a first-year studying <ins>engineering</ins> with the intention of going into electrical or computer engineering.
    I am also considering adding another major in <strong>economics.</strong>
    I chose to study ECE because it's a very <em>versatile major</em> and I can do a lot with it in today's world.
    I chose to study economics and probably not graduate in 4 years because I'm very interested in finance as well as engineering.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 50x; color: #FF0000; text-align: center">I used to work as an intern at a nonprofit called Hemophilia of North Carolina.
    It involved a lot of Microsoft Excel, answering phone calls, and a lot of odd jobs.
    Overall, it was a very productive use of my summer.
