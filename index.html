    <p>Hi there! My name is Namrata (she/her/hers).</p>
    <p2> I'm a student at NC State University (go Wolfpack!) studying computer engineering and economics. I'm interested in exploring computers from the ground up- starting from the base circuitry and electrical principles and ending with high-level software.</p2>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p3> I've always had an interest in the humanities, and take any opportunity I can to use my technical knowledge to contribute to positive civic and social change. As a dual-degree student in economics, I seek to apply my knowledge of trade-offs to enhance my hardware engineering skillset, as well as gain a deep understanding of the policies affecting our society and how data naalysis and technology can address them.
