      <h3>Rise Against Hunger Learning Survey (HackNC 2020)</h3>
      <p>I worked with a team of three other wonderful women from my school to build a web app prototype for Rise Against Hunger, a local non-profit battling food insecurity. The end product would be a WordPress-compatible interactive quiz on various facts about the scope of world hunger, with a contact form at the end. <strong>For my part, I coded a JavaScript version of the quiz which provided the user with various resources depending on their choice of learning path</strong> as well as experimented with PHP to help create a Wordpress plugin. <strong> Our prototype won both the HackNC 2020 Nonprofit Challenge and placed in the top 25 overall to win the Wolfram Award.</strong> <br /><br /> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/rise-against-hunger-learning-survey" target="_blank"><strong>Project Link</strong></a></p>

      <h3>Byte's School Survival Hacks (TechTogether New York 2020)</h3>
      <p>This was another team project with three amazing women from NC State! We built an app prototype to help freshmen navigate their first year of college, which included a GPA calculator, a quiz to find your learning style, forums to meet other students, and an admin portal for faculty. <strong> I built a quiz in JavaScript to identify user learning styles based on user answers and provide resources to find how you learn best based on quiz results, and styled webpages using HTML/CSS.</strong><br /><br /> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/byte-s-school-survival-hacks" target="_blank"><strong>Project Link</strong></a></p>
